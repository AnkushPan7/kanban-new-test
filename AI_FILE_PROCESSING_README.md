# ðŸ¤– AI File Processing Feature

## Overview
The Kanban Board now includes AI-powered file processing capabilities that can automatically:
- Solve mathematical equations
- Format and clean documents
- Optimize code and content
- Process various file types

## How to Use

### 1. Create a Task with Files
1. Click "âž• Add Task"
2. Fill in task details (title, description, priority, etc.)
3. **Upload files** using the "ðŸ“Ž Attach Files" button
4. **Write a clear description** of what needs to be done

### 2. Example Task Descriptions
- **"Solve the equations in this file"** - AI will solve mathematical equations
- **"Format and clean this document"** - AI will improve formatting and readability
- **"Optimize this code for better performance"** - AI will optimize code structure
- **"Calculate the results from this data"** - AI will perform calculations

### 3. Process Files with AI
1. After creating the task, you'll see a "ðŸ¤– Process with AI" button on the card
2. Click the button to start AI processing
3. AI will analyze the files and apply changes based on your description
4. Processed files will be automatically downloaded

## Supported File Types

### Text & Code Files
- **Code**: `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.py`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.c`, `.html`, `.css`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.sql`
- **Text**: `.txt`, `.md`, `.log`, `.csv`

### Image Files (Coming Soon)
- `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.svg`

## AI Processing Examples

### Mathematical Equations
**Input:**
```
2x + 3 = 7
5y - 2 = 13
```

**AI Output:**
```
2x + 3 = 7 â†’ x = 2
5y - 2 = 13 â†’ y = 3
```

### Content Formatting
**Input:** Messy text with extra spaces and poor formatting

**AI Output:** Clean, well-formatted text with proper spacing and line breaks

### Code Optimization
**Input:** Code with redundant variables and inefficient patterns

**AI Output:** Optimized code with better performance and readability

## How It Works

1. **File Upload**: Files are uploaded and stored with the task
2. **AI Analysis**: AI analyzes file content and task description
3. **Processing**: AI applies appropriate transformations based on the description
4. **File Generation**: Modified files are created with AI changes
5. **Download**: Processed files are automatically downloaded
6. **Status Tracking**: Processing status and results are displayed on the task card

## Current Limitations

- **File Size**: Large files may take longer to process
- **Complex Tasks**: Very complex mathematical problems may require human review
- **Image Processing**: Currently limited to basic operations
- **File Replacement**: Processed files are downloaded rather than replacing originals

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Processing**: Live updates during file processing
- **Advanced AI Models**: Integration with more sophisticated AI services
- **File Replacement**: Direct file system integration
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files simultaneously
- **Custom AI Models**: Train AI on specific file types or domains

## Troubleshooting

### File Not Processing
- Ensure file type is supported
- Check file size (should be under 10MB)
- Verify task description is clear and specific

### Processing Errors
- Check console for error messages
- Ensure files are not corrupted
- Try simpler task descriptions

### Download Issues
- Check browser download settings
- Ensure no popup blockers are active
- Try refreshing the page

## Example Workflow

1. **Create Task**: "Solve equations in math homework"
2. **Upload File**: `homework.txt` with equations
3. **Process with AI**: Click "ðŸ¤– Process with AI" button
4. **AI Processing**: AI solves equations and formats results
5. **Download**: Get `processed_homework.txt` with solutions
6. **Review**: Check AI results and make any necessary adjustments

This feature transforms your Kanban board into an intelligent file processing workspace! ðŸš€
